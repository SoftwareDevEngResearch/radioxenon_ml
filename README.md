# radioxenon_ml

This is a package that is intended to conduct a maximum likelihood analysis on a spectrum created from various injected radioxenon samples.
The spectrum shall be an x-by-x 2D historgam.
The relative contribution of each isotope, plus background, will be determined from simulation data for each individual isotope.
The simulation data will be extracted from MCNP.
