# radioxenon_ml

This is a package that is intended to conduct a maximum likelihood analysis on a spectrum created from various injected radioxenon samples.
The spectrum shall be an x-by-x 2D historgam.
The relative contribution of each isotope, plus background, will be determined from simulation data for each individual isotope.
The simulation data will be extracted from MCNP.
The 2D experimental spectrum will be generated in MATLAB for the time being.
